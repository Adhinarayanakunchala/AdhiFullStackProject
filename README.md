3. Academic Records: The system includes features to manage academic records, such as recording attendance, tracking grades, and generating reports. This helps educators monitor student progress and provides a centralized platform to manage academic information efficiently.

4. Communication: The system facilitates effective communication between administrators, teachers, and parents/guardians. It includes features such as messaging and notifications, allowing stakeholders to stay informed about important updates, events, and announcements.

5. User Roles and Permissions: The system incorporates role-based access control, defining different levels of access for administrators, teachers, and students. This ensures data privacy and restricts unauthorized access to sensitive information.

6. User-Friendly Interface: The system is designed with a user-friendly interface, providing an intuitive and seamless experience for administrators, teachers, and students. The interface is responsive, enabling access from various devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.

Overall, the Student Management System simplifies the management of student information, enhances communication between stakeholders, and promotes efficient administrative processes. By leveraging Java, J2EE technology, MySQL, and React Js, this project offers a robust and scalable solution for educational institutions to streamline their operations and improve student management.
